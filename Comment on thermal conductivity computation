The OCTP plugin uses the stress per atom computation of LAMMPS to yield the MSD of heat flux from which the thermal
conductivity can be computed. However, the OCTP user should be aware of the fact that the atomic stress approximation
may produce erroneous results in the case of heat flux when applied to systems with many-body interactions (e.g., angles, 
torsions, improper torsions). This results in incorrect thermal conductivity values. More details can be found in the 
work by Surblys et al. (PHYSICAL REVIEW E 99, 051301, 2019 - DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.99.051301).
