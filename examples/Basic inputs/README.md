In this example, transport properties of an equimolar mixture of water-methanol is computed at 298 K and 1 atm by using the new commands provided by the OCTP plugin. The TraPPE united-atom force field is used for the methanol molecule combined with the SPC/E water model. These force field paramters are specified in the file "forcefield.data". The configuration of the system consisting of 250 water and 250 methanol molecules is provided in the file "data.system". The simulation procedure, which is the input to the LAMMPS executable file, is specified in the file "simulation.in".

This example was tested on the LAMMPS version 27 Nov. 2018.
